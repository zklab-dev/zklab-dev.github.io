      <description>Veteran compiler engineer. Xin has extensive experience in language implementation and optimization. Previously, Xin has worked in multiple world-class compiler teams in Facebook, Apple and Intel. Xin wrote a significant part of the Swift optimizer during his time at Apple, most of the optimizations are still in use in Xcode after four years. In the past few years, Xin has helped Facebook transition from gcc to clang compiler.
Particularly, Xin served as the technical lead in improving core compiler optimizations and link time optimization such that Facebook does not lose (or in some cases gain) performance while doing the toolchain transition.</description>
